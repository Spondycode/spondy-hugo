## Busy with the SuperCamper website and Learning More

I ran into a problem with the log in for the website and I decided to make a fresh start and add in parts of what I had done already. I spent far too long trying to fix the bit that had gone wrong. The onboarding of the profile page when creating a new user got messed up. The log in happened and the user was created but failed to show the righ web page. I don't mind starting again with it because I'm still learning. I wanted to see how it went with bringing in apps made in one project into a new project. I found I could do it but it is also a bit challenging to get everything functioning properly. So far with the new version I have the profiles working but there is one part not quite right. It is a problem I solved before with the first try at the web site. I just can't remember how I did it.???


## Working with Tailwind

I've been setting up Tailwind to work on a single page website. I like Tailwind and I'm going to try DaisyUI with it. Seems to make it a bit like XXX with the compnoents already set up and ready to go. Could make the development go quicker. I've started a tutorial which will show me how to set it up and I'm looking forward to see how it is done.
