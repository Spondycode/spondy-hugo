## Giving New Life to my Old 2017 iMac

I had the great idea that I could just wipe the hard drive and install Arch Linux on my old iMac. It has got desperately slow running Ventura and it is just sitting there doing nothing. Not working though... I am getting a error in that is seems not to see the SSD internal drive and keeps trying every 10 seconds until I break the loop. I haven't given up yet but it is making me wonder what's going on. 

This is on top of another problem that surfaced with a Spanish government website which is not letting me into a page I needed. I had a certificate set up on that iMac just for that website entry. It was the reason I kept the computer as it was when I got my M1 MacBook Pro. So that was annoying too. Something else which allowed me to get into the government websites a thing call Cl@ve also needs to be updated. These things are sent to try us....

## I could just get another computer and sell that iMac

I could sell it off and get enough for it to buy a computer which would run Linux nicely. Maybe even a new one.I am finding the 13in MacBook too small screen wise for some of the stuff I do. Or maybe I have just got used to having two massive 32in monitors connected to the MacBook. All of these are first world problems and I should not let it annoy me so much.
