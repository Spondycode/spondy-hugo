## Last Month I Bought a Split Keyboard – A ZSA Voyager

I was getting a bit fed up with having my arms scrunched together, trying to find just the right angle for my wrists while using the keyboard on my Mac laptop. While I try to dictate as much as possible, I still use the keyboard quite a lot. Now that I’m writing and creating applications using Flutterflow, I find myself relying on the keyboard even more.

This keyboard was a bit pricey, but after watching many videos of people trying out various models, the ZSA Voyager seemed like the one to get. Since I was already facing the challenge of learning a completely different keyboard, I figured I might as well switch to a new layout at the same time. I decided to go with the Colemak DH layout. Initially, I considered Dvorak, but many people recommended Colemak DH as the better option. So, I’ve been busy practicing touch typing with this new layout.

## It Hasn't Been Easy

The first couple of days, I thought I must have been crazy to try this. But I stuck with it, and I’ve been using a website called Monkeytype to train. I’m starting to reach a point where I think it was a good idea, and I’m happy with the progress I’ve made.

I’m not sure how many words per minute I used to type on a standard QWERTY keyboard, but I’ve gone from a painfully slow four or five words per minute to a not-so-bad 12 to 14 words per minute. I’m actually using the right fingers for the correct keys and beginning to hit the right key without thinking about it sometimes. When I see people managing 80 words or more per minute, I can’t quite understand how that’s even possible!

When I started using this keyboard, I had a layout with modified home row keys, but I found that it didn’t work well. I’d press a key but hold it down too long, so I wouldn’t get the character I wanted. It felt as though I was accidentally triggering Control, Option, or Command keys. I’m not sure if it’s possible to adjust the tap-and-hold timing settings, but I decided to move the modifier keys elsewhere. It’s working much better now.
