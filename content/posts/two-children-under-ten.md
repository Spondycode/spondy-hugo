## Teaching Code to 2 small Children is Like Herding Cats

Impossible to do! All that happens is fun and hilarity for them and frustration for the teacher. Driving me nuts to try it. My grand daughter wanted to catch up to where her brother had got with the code and was doing just great. She was learning quickly although not as confident in her answers. Just needed a bit of coaxing to put the code in.
