## Old iPhone to Oliver

Hopefully it will be OK with his parents to let him have the phone.
He can use it to learn some Python and keep in contact with me to help him with the learning. I'd rather give him an iPad but that is too much money for a new one. For now anyway. Will he be able to behave himself with the phone. Kids find this sort of thing addictive.

## I need to use a different Apple ID to set it up

Or get George to set it up as the parent controlling the account. It is possible to lock the phone down so he doesn't abuse the priviledge of having a computer in his pocket.
