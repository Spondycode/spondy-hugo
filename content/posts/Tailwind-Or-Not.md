## Tailwind or Not to Tailwind

The project that I’ve been working on by Andreas Judd has been using tailwind and I quite liked it. I hadn’t got to the point where he was showing what we needed to do to put the tailwind into proper action. It was using the CDN which is okay for development but not for deployment. I looked at a video showing how to use tailwind with Django and it looked very complicated indeed. It completely put me off and I started looking at other possibilities including W3 – CSS which is more of a alternative to Bootstrap. This looked very interesting and I spent the whole day learning the possibilities of using that Version of CSS. Then I came back to the next playlist of Andreas Judd showing how to deploy the project we’ve been working on. He made it look much easier, even though there were quite a lot of steps to follow to get the job done. So once again I’m looking at Tailwind and I plan to give it another try when I do my own camping website.

## Neovim or VS Code

I was using them for a few months and really enjoying it. For some reason I decided to have another look at the code. I think it was because in the code there are a few plug-ins you can use which make things a little bit easier. You do some of the ease and functionality you get by using neovim but you make up for it in other ways. Some aspects of editing the text is easier VS Code and then again some things are much easier using Neovim. It would be nice to have the best of both worlds and I’m toying with the idea of using a vim extension within VS Code. I’ll give it a try and see how it works out. I love the thing I found within VS Code is that there is the possibility of using the live server extension. When working with straightforward HTML it makes it easy to see how things are looking with the page you’re working on.

Another thing with VS Code is that is easy to add the extension for Copilot although I think it’s also possible to add it to Neovim. Copilot is a artificial intelligence for coding and I think it looks really quite interesting. The only problem I have with it is the price of it. It is €10 a month or $10 a month and I’ve been trying to cut out the number of subscriptions I buy. As it is, I can use Chat Gpt to help me with the code to see whether I’ve made mistakes. I think the way that it works with copilot is that you putting in some comments of what you wanted to do and it will give you options of code which will do what it is you’re looking for. Is it going to help me learn how to code better or is it going to make me lazy?
