## Django Sign In

I've been working on a Django project and I've been trying to get the sign in to work. I've been following a tutorial and I've been trying to get it to work. I've been having a few problems with it. I left a note on the YouTube tutorial which I was following and the author of the tutorial got back to me to give me information on how to fix it so that I can make it work. I'd still like to know how to make it save username instead of having the email as the username. Not sure if I want to use that or whether I should be using the Django Allauth which allows you to get users to login using Facebook or Google and quite a few other things as well. I'll have to do some reading to find out what possibilities I have and how easy it is going to be to set it up.

## Learning Go-Lang

Spend some time this week learning how to write in the language go. I've been following some tutorials which have been given me the basics. There were a few things that I was getting a little bit confused with regards the modules. Starting to get a bit more idea about how it works. The basics of it is not too difficult and I find it better than trying to work with JavaScript. There is a gin framework which I'd like to find out about. I have already been out to set it up to connect to a mango database which is a good thing. I've still got a long way to go to find out about how Golang works, but I'm gonna give it a try. Although, I'm thinking that perhaps I should start to work with Swift. I did buy an inexpensive course to start learning swift.

I've also already Learned a bit of swift when showing Oliver how to get started with coding. In the swift playgrounds app on the iPad. Last week or the week before I also did something with swift, that was a tutorial showing you how to get started with it and asked made a program that worked on my Mac. I'd like to think that I could do something with the camping website which would allow me to make it as a iOS app and maybe an app for android. There are a few possibilities such as using something called flutter which lets you code so that you want to do it for both android and iOS.
