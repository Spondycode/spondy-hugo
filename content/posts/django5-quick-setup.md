Moving forward, Dave demonstrates how to create a Django app, named "Sponditious," within the project. He uses terminal commands and showcases the folder structure created by Django for the app.

### Configuring URLs and Views

The configuration of URLs and views within the Django app is critical for routing and rendering content. Dave meticulously guides you through creating URL patterns and corresponding views for the app's functionality.

### Implementing Templates and HTML Files

A critical aspect of web development involves creating templates (HTML files) to render content. Dave explains the process of setting up the template directories and creating basic HTML files for the Django app.

### Securing Secrets with .env Files

Protecting sensitive information like secret keys is paramount. Dave demonstrates how to use .env files to store confidential data securely, utilizing Django-environ to access these variables within the Django settings.

Dave goes above and beyond by introducing Django All Auth, enabling users to log in using Facebook or other social accounts. He outlines the installation process, configuration in settings.py, and the necessary steps to integrate social login features.

### Version Control and Deployment Preparation

Finally, Dave illustrates version controlling with Git, setting up a repository on GitHub, and explains the process of pushing the local Django project to the remote repository.

### Conclusion

By following this comprehensive guide, you'll have a fully functional Django project set up, complete with authentication features using Django All Auth. You'll be equipped to expand and customize this base to suit your specific web development needs.
