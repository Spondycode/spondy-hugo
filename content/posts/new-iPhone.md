## Nymeria 15

I name all of my iPhone Nymeria after the wolf belonging to, I think, Arya in Game of Thrones. Other parts of my computer system also are named from characters in GoT. I'm just funny that way.

I still have to send the old ohone back to Apple. I'm waiting for the box to arrive so I can send it on. It might arrive today.

## Extras for the iPhone

I ordered a case from Quadlock and I also have another case comeing from Amazon. The Quadlock will take a few more days to arrive and I don't want to use the ne iPhone in the wild without a case. Not really safe to use in the house naked, considering we have hard tile floors. I could also be away in the mountains when the case arrives and I need something before then. Certainly if we decide to go by motorcycle. More likely to go in the car though. Too much to carry for the bikes. 

Also have ordered a Mag battery. I went for the Anker version with the 10,000 mA size. With the extra coupon I got it for a good price. I can use it it on the desk also as a mount. Put it on and it will be charging at the same time as being useful in front of me. I might need to buy more USB C cables. Some A to C and a couple more C to C. The included cable from Apple with the phone is not a fast cable. If I want to use an external hard drive then I will best use a faster cable. I might have one here somewhere. I wonder how I can measure the throughput of data.

## Smaller and Lighter iPhone

Pleased with the smaller phone still. Not really that much difference in use and once the old phone is gone I will not be tempted to compare the two sizes. I notice the pages is shorter so I have to do a bit more scrolling to see information on the screen. So the resolution is the same I think. I was worried that the keyboard would be smaller and would lead to more duff keypresses when typing. No more than with the bigger old phone. Besides I like to use Voice Control as much as possible.
