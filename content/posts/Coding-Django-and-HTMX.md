## Course by Andreas Judd

Really good course which is mostly about Django and creating a web site with it. He also uses Tailwind for the CSS styling and has a good, orgainised way to set up the web pages. To make the site more interactive he shows us HTMX and another thing which builds on that so no Javascript is needed to make things happen, So far, I'm on lesson 19 and I've learned a huge amount and it mostly all makes sense to me.

Andreas does have a Patreon running and you might need to sign up if you want to get the pre written code he makes for the inbox page. It is perfectly reasonable to do this, he's put a lot of effort into making this excellent course. I will probably send a bit of cash his way because I have learned so much from following along. He doesn't have that many subscribers for hi YouTube Channel, which is a bit of a surprise, unless it is still too new. 

## I Might have to Learn Tailwind CSS

Other channels with Django use the Bootstrap CSS, but Andreas uses Tailwind. It may not be as simple as Bootstrap and it could still be a better option. I'm not sure yet and will have to learn some Tailwind just to make my mind up.

## Going Forward With my Own Website

I can't just use the Django I have created in the tutorial for my own website. I might still be referring back though when I need parts to get what I do need on the site to function the way I want. Hopefully I can work it out.
