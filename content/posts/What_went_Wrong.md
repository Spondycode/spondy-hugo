## Still Working out how this works


The commandline command makes the file then you have to go in and write it. Now I have fiddled with the site a bit the meta data at the top is different.


I was wondering if I could just make a markdown file in the correct folder and it would get put on the site. I will experiment and see if it works.

### Pictures are easy to add


Just have to remember the markdown code. I see there are some special codes you can use to add things like YouTube videos.
