## Learning Swift Again

I looked at learning Swift before and years ago I was interested in finding out how to make iOS apps and Objective C was the requirement. Didn't too far with Objective C. More recently I have used Swift Playgrounds to teach my grandson coding principles and it was fun as well and highly instructive. He soon got the idea as far as functions, for loops and while loops were concerned.

## Tutorials

So I saw a tutorial on YouTube and gave a bit of time and it seemed to stick with me, a bit. So I jumped back into Swith Playgrounds both on the Mac and on the iPad. I have to say I like Python and Django more. It's not that bad though. Quite pleasing to make thing happen and actually install an app I made on my Mac. It has me thinking I could make an app for my current web project. So I will devote some time to learning some Swift here and there. It will increase my abilities coding in any case.
