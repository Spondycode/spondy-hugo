## Really disappointed with my iMac

I wanted to put Arch Linux on the machine but it won't let me. I also tried with Ubuntu and that wasn't having any of it either. I tried formatting the disk as Fat32 and still it would not play ball with me. With both of them it just would not recognise the hard drive. So I have go to plan B which is to just put Mac OS on there again and see if the Mac is more responsive with a fresh system. I have got Mac OS Sierra being installed as I write this. I still wouldn't mind trying out Arch Linux and I think my only possibility for the moment is using a virtual machine. I'll try it on Digital Ocean or Linode.

## N8N

I tried to get into N8N which is a rival to Make and Zapier but much cheaper, especially if you host it yourself. The set up on a Digital Ocean Droplet was pretty easy. Just have not yet found a automation that I can make work or do something interesting for me. I was wondering if I could get it to do something with my app. So for instance when a message is received I could have N8N send a text message to the right place. Now, that could be pretty cool.
