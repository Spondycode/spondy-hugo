## Introduction to GoodandGeeky


I like the way I can do this in **Markdown** in the terminal. So much easier than working with html. Should be really fast to get the blog posts online.


### Changed the Theme from terminal


I will need to do something with the theme of the site to make it look a little decent.


### Cloudflare is Pretty Amazing !


Doing this through CloudFlare. So easy and I also set up a domain with them too. Noce that it has all been free so far apart from the cost of the domain.
