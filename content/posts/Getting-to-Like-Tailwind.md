## Getting To Like Tailwind

I’ve been researching more about how Tailwind works and experimenting with a website. I've successfully integrated Tailwind into a Django project, and it’s all looking very good. The only thing I’m worried about at the moment is the possibility that it's going to be more difficult to deploy. I’m wondering if it’ll be harder because I’m not using a CDN to provide the framework. With Tailwind, it gets installed on the server (well, you can also do that with Bootstrap). Other developers have overcome this problem, so I’m sure I’ll be able to sort it out as well.

On one hand, it’s nice to have everything in one tin, where you put all of your CSS classes into the HTML document. You don’t have to keep going back and forth between the CSS and HTML to craft the look of your webpage. On the other hand, it does look a little messy when you're building it. Supposedly, it makes things more difficult when you’re working on something and it just looks chaotic with so much code in there. However, there is a VS Code plug-in that will fold up all of the Tailwind – you just have to click on it to unfold so you can work on it. There is also another VS Code plug-in that automatically arranges the order of the Tailwind tags. This is useful if you’re working with other people, and it’s also helpful when you’re working alone and you always want to see them in a particular order. You kind of know what to expect when you are looking at the code.

The big project I’ve been working on is probably too far gone down the line for me to change it from Bootstrap to Tailwind. That’s a shame, and I wish I had stuck with Tailwind when I was following the tutorial on which I based most of my code for my website. If I have to do any sort of complete rewrite, then next time I will certainly build it all using Tailwind.
