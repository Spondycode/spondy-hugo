## Started Learning Flutter

Have to learn Dart with Flutter but it could be coould in the long run because I want to make Android and iOS apps for SuperCamper, my web app. Will be nice if I can write the code once and have it in all the places I need it. Finding a good course will be the thing. I started on by Angela Yu because her Python course was OK. But she is using Android Studio instead of VS Code for that. I have found someone else who is using VSC and it might work out but he is not as good as Andreas Jud who is brillianrt with Django and the website stuff. I'll give it a go anyway.

## SuperCamper is coming on bit by bit

Have been working on the site for a while now and lately I wanted to add another app on the Supercamper site. I want a blog on there and it was proving difficult. I tried a couple of different ways to make it. I cot a bit confused by using two different solutions.I'll have to make a decision to choose just one.

## Farting about with TMUX

It's been a while since I was using mainly Neovim and Tmux. Instead of fiddling around with that I've been using VS Code which I am getting to like. Having CoPilot in there has been great and saved me loads of time. Today I had a day of messing and I had to fix Tmux to work right again. Fun, but not that productive.
