## If you want help..

I'll put a contact form on here or some other way to send me a message. I don't really like email because it isn't secure. 

### Email


Maybe I can put in a list of contact options using End to End Encrypted messaging apps. If we have to use email then it will be better to use encryption. PGP/GPG isn't difficult once you get into the 'Pair' of keys concept. Send me an encrypted email to spondicious@protonmail.com


Or go to my [YouTube Channel Community Page](https://www.youtube.com/@Good-and-Geeky/community) and send me a message that way. Either in a comment on a video or just a message on the community page.

### Threema - NHS3UK3Y

I like the [Threema](https://threema.ch/en/download) messaging service. You have to pay for it but it isn't much $5. At least you are **not** the product, as you are with google email addresses.
