## Spondicious Dev | Spondycode


I've been learning Python for a while now and finding that I love it with Django. Even though there is a cute simplicity with using Hugo to make a static site, Django is just so capable. I've only scratched the surface of Django so far. Learning what's the best way to do things, because there are so many ways to skin a cat. Some people like make things happen in Django and others want to work it differently. Takes a while to find out which you prefer when you are new to the platform. I like to keep things simple where ever possible.


## Django is Excellent


A really good framework on top of Python so I can make web pages. I like it better than FastAPI.
